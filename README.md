# VROPS-REST-API-ANSIBLE

Using this script we pretend to use the REST API of VROPS, passing the request from the local installation of Ansible.

The current exmaple allow us to login getting a token and to create users once the token is available.

Next will be to split the get of the token and complicate with more actions if nneded calling from a main.yml and passing all to modules (User creation, login, etc)
